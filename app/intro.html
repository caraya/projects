This project is a demonstration of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/) using [Mongolab](https://mongolab.com/) as the backend.

This is an evolution from my [Bootstrap / Firebase](https://caraya.github.io/project-list-angular/firebase.html) and [Polymer / Firebase](http://caraya.github.io/polymer-list/firebase.html) projects that were just a way to get familiar with the technology.  This version of the project list seeks to build a reusable set of tools to build mongoDB-based apps with, at least, basic CRUD functionality.
